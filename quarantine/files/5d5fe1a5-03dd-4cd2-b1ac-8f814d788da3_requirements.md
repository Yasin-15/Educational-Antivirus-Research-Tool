# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an educational antivirus research tool built in Python that helps users understand how antivirus software works through hands-on learning. The system will include harmless test files that simulate malware signatures, detection algorithms, quarantine management, and reporting features. This tool is designed purely for educational purposes to teach cybersecurity concepts in a safe, controlled environment on authorized systems only.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity student, I want to scan files for known malware signatures, so that I can understand how signature-based detection works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates a file scan THEN the system SHALL check files against a database of known harmless test signatures
2. WHEN a signature match is found THEN the system SHALL log the detection with file path, signature name, and timestamp
3. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary report of detected test files
4. IF a file cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue scanning other files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to create and manage harmless test malware samples, so that I can test detection algorithms safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a test sample THEN the system SHALL generate a harmless file with embedded test signatures
2. WHEN test samples are created THEN the system SHALL store metadata including creation date, signature type, and description
3. WHEN managing samples THEN the system SHALL provide options to list, view details, and delete test samples
4. IF a test sample already exists with the same name THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before overwriting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to simulate behavioral analysis detection, so that I can demonstrate how heuristic scanning works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN behavioral analysis is enabled THEN the system SHALL analyze file characteristics like size, entropy, and file type
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL assign a risk score from 1-10
3. WHEN the risk score exceeds a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL flag the file as potentially suspicious
4. IF behavioral analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to signature-based detection only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quarantine detected files, so that I can safely isolate potentially harmful content for further analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL offer options to quarantine, ignore, or delete the file
2. WHEN a file is quarantined THEN the system SHALL move it to a secure quarantine directory with restricted permissions
3. WHEN viewing quarantined files THEN the system SHALL display file details, detection reason, and quarantine date
4. WHEN restoring from quarantine THEN the system SHALL move the file back to its original location if possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to generate detailed scan reports, so that I can analyze detection patterns and system security status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scan completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with scan statistics
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include detected threats, scan duration, files processed, and system recommendations
3. WHEN saving reports THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including JSON, CSV, and human-readable text
4. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and save basic scan results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity instructor, I want to configure detection sensitivity and rules, so that I can customize the learning experience for different skill levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to adjust signature matching sensitivity
2. WHEN setting behavioral thresholds THEN the system SHALL validate that values are within acceptable ranges (1-10)
3. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL save settings persistently for future sessions
4. IF invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and use default values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view educational information about detected threats, so that I can learn about different types of malware and detection techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a threat is detected THEN the system SHALL provide educational information about the threat type
2. WHEN viewing threat details THEN the system SHALL explain the detection method used and why it was flagged
3. WHEN browsing threat database THEN the system SHALL display descriptions of different malware families and signatures
4. IF educational content is missing THEN the system SHALL display basic technical details about the detection
