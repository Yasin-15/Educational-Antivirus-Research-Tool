THREAT SUMMARIES
----------------------------------------
🚨 EICAR (Risk: 2/10)
📁 File: test_samples/eicar.txt
🔍 Method: Signature Matching
📋 Category: Test_File
💡 A harmless test file used to verify antivirus functionality.

🚨 High Entropy Content (Risk: 7/10)
📁 File: samples/high_entropy_test.bin
🔍 Method: Entropy Analysis
📋 Category: Suspicious_Behavior
💡 Files with unusually high entropy that may indicate encryption, compression, or obfuscation.

🚨 Suspicious File Extension (Risk: 6/10)
📁 File: samples/test_script.bat
🔍 Method: Pattern Recognition
📋 Category: Suspicious_Behavior
💡 Files with extensions commonly associated with executable or potentially dangerous content.

LEARNING RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

Based on your scan results, consider learning about:

📝 SIGNATURE-BASED DETECTION:
  • How antivirus signatures are created
  • Limitations of signature-only detection
  • The importance of signature database updates

📊 ENTROPY ANALYSIS:
  • Mathematical concepts in cybersecurity
  • How malware uses obfuscation
  • Legitimate vs. suspicious high-entropy content

⚡ MEDIUM-RISK DETECTIONS:
  • Practice threat assessment skills
  • Learn about risk scoring methodologies
  • Study false positive analysis

💡 NEXT STEPS:
  • Review the detailed explanations for each detection
  • Create additional test samples for practice
  • Experiment with different detection settings
  • Study real-world cybersecurity case studies
