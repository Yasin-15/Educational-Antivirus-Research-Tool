## üìä Performance Optimization

### Understanding Performance Settings

| Setting | Impact | Recommended Values |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| `signature_sensitivity` | Detection speed vs accuracy | 5-7 for balanced performance |
| `max_file_size_mb` | Scan scope vs speed | 10-25 MB for most use cases |
| `behavioral_threshold` | Analysis depth vs speed | 6-8 for balanced analysis |
| `entropy_threshold` | Packed file detection | 7.0 for standard detection |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **For Speed**:
   ```json
   {
     "signature_sensitivity": 7,
     "max_file_size_mb": 10,
     "behavioral_threshold": 8,
     "recursive_scan": false
   }
   ```

2. **For Accuracy**:
   ```json
   {
     "signature_sensitivity": 3,
     "max_file_size_mb": 50,
     "behavioral_threshold": 4,
     "recursive_scan": true
   }
   ```

3. **For Balance**:
   ```json
   {
     "signature_sensitivity": 5,
     "max_file_size_mb": 25,
     "behavioral_threshold": 6,
     "recursive_scan": true
   }
   ```

### System Resource Management

- **Memory**: Monitor usage during large scans
