# Multi-Stage Malware Simulation - EDUCATIONAL ONLY
# This file simulates the behavior patterns of multi-stage malware
# It contains NO executable code and is completely harmless

## Stage 1: Initial Infection Vector
# Simulated email attachment or drive-by download
INITIAL_VECTOR = "email_attachment_simulation"
PAYLOAD_URL = "http://example-malware-c2.invalid/payload"

## Stage 2: Environment Reconnaissance  
# Malware typically gathers system information
SYSTEM_INFO_COLLECTION = [
    "Operating System Version",
    "Installed Security Software", 
    "Network Configuration",
    "Running Processes",
    "User Privileges"
]

## Stage 3: Persistence Establishment
# Common persistence mechanisms
PERSISTENCE_METHODS = [
    "Registry Run Keys",
    "Scheduled Tasks",
    "Service Installation", 
    "Startup Folder",
    "DLL Hijacking"
]

## Stage 4: Command and Control
# Communication with remote servers
C2_COMMUNICATION = {
    "protocol": "HTTPS",
    "encryption": "AES-256",
    "beacon_interval": "300 seconds",
    "backup_domains": ["backup1.invalid", "backup2.invalid"]
}

## Stage 5: Payload Execution
# Final malicious activities
PAYLOAD_ACTIVITIES = [
    "Data Exfiltration",
    "Credential Harvesting",
    "Lateral Movement",
    "Additional Payload Download"
]

# Educational Note: This simulation helps understand the complexity
# of modern malware and the importance of multi-layered defense
