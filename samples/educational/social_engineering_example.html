    <h1>Social Engineering Techniques Demo</h1>
    <p class="warning">THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION - NOT A REAL ATTACK</p>
    
    <h2>Common Social Engineering Tactics:</h2>
    
    <div class="urgent">
        <h3>1. Urgency and Fear</h3>
        <p>"Your account will be suspended in 24 hours unless you verify immediately!"</p>
        <p><em>Educational Note: Creates pressure to act without thinking</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Authority Impersonation</h3>
    <p>"This is your IT department. We need your password for security updates."</p>
    <p><em>Educational Note: Exploits trust in authority figures</em></p>
    
    <h3>3. Curiosity Exploitation</h3>
    <p>"You won't believe what your coworker said about you - click here!"</p>
    <p><em>Educational Note: Uses human curiosity as attack vector</em></p>
    
    <h3>4. Reciprocity</h3>
    <p>"We've selected you for a special offer as a valued customer..."</p>
    <p><em>Educational Note: Makes victim feel special or obligated</em></p>
    
    <h3>5. Scarcity</h3>
    <p>"Limited time offer - only 3 spots remaining!"</p>
    <p><em>Educational Note: Creates false sense of scarcity</em></p>
    
    <h2>Defense Strategies:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify requests through independent channels</li>
        <li>Be suspicious of urgent requests</li>
        <li>Never provide credentials via email or phone</li>
        <li>Check URLs carefully before clicking</li>
        <li>When in doubt, ask IT security team</li>
    </ul>
